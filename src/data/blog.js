    one: "I'm a business owner and founder of Yenge consultancy, which does pretty much everything EDI (Equity, Diversity & Inclusion) across public, private and charitable sectors. No day is the same. A day in my life can be delivering training, or helping companies to start their EDI journey through audit, strategy and policy development, writing blogs, webinars or panel discussions. It also means that I get to be involved in great projects such as the WIN Design Lab. There's so much work still to be done to increase the sense of belonging of people in our society. I'm always ready to do anything I can to help make that happen.",
    two: "I had worked with The Black Leadership Group for years and believe in their mission and values. When I heard about their collaboration with DK&amp;A on the Design Lab programme,I saw it as a chance to make a positive impact. I’ve never come across an organisation like DK&A before, whose focus is design thinking. Its such a great way to innovate in the EDI space. Even though I'm an 'expert' into the EDI space, I've got so much to learn still.",
    three:
      "Communication. One of the things that makes the Design Lab so powerful is the opportunity to communicate and collaborate. Knowing that many people have signed up for this program and are brave enough and ready to do this, gives me a warm feeling inside. It shows how many organisations care about making their people a priority, to ensure they succeed and feel a sense of belonging. Ultimately that's why people are here.",
    four: "The Sector Co-Creation event at City Hall. To spend time in-person with my colleagues, fellow coaches and the participants, the feeling we're all in this together. Also hearing from the guest speakers, with their amazing inspirational stories, plus the chance to physically interact with people that previously Id' only interacted with on a screen. The day was buzzing, full of energy, lessons learned, lots of sharing and it was great fun too.",
